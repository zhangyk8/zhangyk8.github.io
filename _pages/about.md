I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at University of Washington (UW), Seattle, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/). During 2019-2020, I served as the Master Student Representative for our department. Before joining UW, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2018. During my undergraduate, I was also selected as an honor student at the Yat-Sen Honor College, an elite liberal undergraduate institution of SYSU. 

Research Interests
-----------
My current theoretical research interests lie in
* Nonparametric Statistics (Kernel Smoothing),
* Optimization on Nonlinear Manifolds,
* High-dimensional Inference with Missing Data,
* Causal Inference for Continuous Treatments.

On the applied side, I am broadly interested in challenging problems in astronomy, with a focus on how to detect and analyze the large-scale structure of the Universe (i.e., cosmic web) in a statistically motivated way.
