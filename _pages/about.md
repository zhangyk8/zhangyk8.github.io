I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington (UW), Seattle, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/). Previously, I obtained my master's degree in Statistics at UW in 2020. Before joining UW, I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2018. 

Research Interests
-----------
My current theoretical research interests lie in
* Nonparametric Statistics (Kernel Smoothing),
* Optimization on Nonlinear Manifolds,
* High-Dimensional Inference with Missing Data,
* Causal Inference for Continuous Treatments,
* Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation.

On the applied side, I am broadly interested in tackling challenging problems in astronomy and beyond, particularly those related to detecting and analyzing the large-scale structure of the Universe (i.e., the cosmic web) through statistically principled approaches.
