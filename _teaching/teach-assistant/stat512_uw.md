### Course Description

STAT 512 is the first course of the statistical inference sequence for first-year PhD and master students in Statistics and Biostatistics departments at the University of Washington. It roughly covers Chapter 1-5 of [Statistical Inference, Second Edition](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~zt001062/MaStmaterials/George%20Casella&Roger%20L.Berger--Statistical%20Inference.pdf) written by George Casella and Roger L. Burger with some selected discussions in Chapter 7 and 10, and STAT 513 covers the rest of the book. Generally, the instructor wrote his own notes for teaching the course; see below. The quiz sessions led by the TA (more precisely, Student Instructor) are designed for 
- reviewing some key concepts in the lectures;
- discussing important concepts that supplement the lectures;
- going through some exercises that help strengthen the understanding of lecture materials or providing insights into other related study fields.

I composed the notes for every quiz session on my own (see below) in Autumn 2022, and they have been the key materials for STAT 512 quiz sessions since 2022.
