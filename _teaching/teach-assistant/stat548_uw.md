### Course Description

CSE547 / STAT548 is a graduate-level machine learning course jointly offered by Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. It covers practical tools and machine learning algorithms for analyzing large-scale or online data; see the course website below for detailed topics and slides created by the instructor. Besides maintaining the course logistics throughout the quarter, the TAs will
- hold recitation sessions for Spark, Probability and Proof Techniques, and Linear Algebra;
- hold weekly hour office;
- grade homework assignments;
- provide detailed feedback on the final projects;
- answer questions on the course discussion platform.
