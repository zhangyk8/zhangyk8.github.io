My dear Soccer, <br/>

Thank you for accompanying me in the last decade, <br/>
During which joy interwove with tears. <br/>
You drove the 16-year-old boy to step on the green grass <br/>
And gave me those lifelong friends. <br/>

When this clumsy and reckless boy always dashed into the crowd <br/>
You did not give me up. <br/>
Instead, you called for the best Captain that I have ever met <br/>
To teach me a philosophy of YOU: <br/>

**Sometimes, passing backward is poised for a better step-forward.** <br/>

As a reward for your great kindness, <br/>
I trained myself harder <br/>
Under Cantonese scorching heat <br/>
Or relentless lightning storm. <br/>

Though I had no talent in speed, <br/>
My stamina made me the fastest in any long-lasting game; <br/>
Though I was not born to be tall, <br/>
My reasonable exercise of positioning helped me control the aerial ball; <br/>
Though I could not cover every square of the field in person, <br/>
My precise passing accomplished it on my behalf. <br/>

Gradually, you endorsed me <br/>
By putting the Captain armband on my hand <br/>
And Jersey Number 10 on my body. <br/>
Leading our team to enter the pitch, <br/>
I kissed the big “C” on my left arm. <br/>
It should have been the sweetest memory between you and me <br/>
Before I lost myself in the Final. <br/>

As a runner-up, I thought about stopping my relationship with you <br/>
By asking one question: <br/>
What is the real meaning of being engaged with you? <br/>
For trophies, recognition, and advocacy? <br/>

The truth is, in sports as in life, <br/>
Every victory comes at a price; <br/>
Every painful experience holds back a pleasure. <br/>
All you want is my heart on you <br/>
And my smile towards the failure. <br/>

I took off the Captain armband and <br/>
Changed the Jersey Number from 10 to 16, <br/>
Returning to the origin to savor every moment we had together. <br/>
But no one can fight against the stream of time. <br/>

_This year is all I have left to give. <br/>
My heart can take the pounding <br/>
My mind can handle the grind <br/>
But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye. (Adopted from a letter written by Kobe Bryant on [The Players' Tribune](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/dear-basketball))_ <br/>

We both know this farewell is not the ultimate terminal of our lives <br/>
But a starting point of a new journey. <br/>
No matter what I do next <br/>
I wish you a brilliant future <br/>
That another 16-year-old boy makes your acquaintance <br/>
With a smile from the bottom of his heart… <br/>
<br/>

Love you always, <br/>
