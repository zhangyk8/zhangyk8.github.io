## Cosmic Filament Detection Through Directional Density Ridges

### Talk Abstract

On megaparsec scales, matter in our Universe is not uniformly distributed but rather forms a complicated large-scale network structure called the cosmic web \[3\]. Such large-scale structure consists of four distinct substructures: dense clusters, interconnected one-dimensional filaments, widespread two-dimensional sheets/walls, and vast near-empty voids. Among them, filament structures are of great research interest because they dominate the cosmic web in terms of matter and provide valuable information about the formation and evolution of nearby galaxies \[4\].

In this talk, we will present the methodology of recovering filaments from galaxy samples in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) \[5\] through directional density ridges, which can be practically estimated via our proposed _Directional Subspace Constrained Mean Shift_ (DirSCMS) algorithm \[1,2\]. Compared to previous filament detection algorithms \[6,7\], the DirSCMS algorithm takes into account the nonlinear geometry of a celestial sphere on which the galaxy samples lie and thus potentially yields less biased estimators of the underlying filament structures. The correlations between some natural properties of galaxies fitted by the Firefly stellar population model \[8\] and their distances to our detected filaments will be studied. If time permits, we will also discuss how to incorporate galaxy properties into the filament detection via a weighted DirSCMS algorithm and address some missing data issues along this process. The talk is based on my recent works with [Prof. Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/index.html).
